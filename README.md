# Vue.js Search Highlighter

This is a Vue.js application that implements a simple search feature where the search term is highlighted within the displayed content. The app allows you to search through titles and bodies of posts, and highlights the search term wherever it matches, without filtering out any posts.

## Features
- Display a list of posts with titles and bodies.
- Highlight the search term in both the title and body while keeping the original case of the content.
- Use Vue.js for the frontend and Composition API for managing state and logic.
- Apply styles to the highlighted text (yellow background).

## Technologies Used
- **Vue 3**: A modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Composition API**: A new way of writing Vue components with more flexible and reusable code.
- **CSS**: Scoped CSS to style the components.
